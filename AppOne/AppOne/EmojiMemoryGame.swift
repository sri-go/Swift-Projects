// Class is easy to share, lives in the heap and has pointers to it -> all of our views can have pointers to it,
// but downfall is that model could be ruined by rogue view, need to protect it by making it "view only"
// and leave edit access to View Model
// adding private makes the model only accessible to EmojiMemoryGame (View Model) -> none of the views can see the model
// you can add private(set) to make it viewable by others but only modifiable by EmojiMemoryGame

// ObservableObject only works for class
// ObservableObject protocol tells SwiftUIâ€™s views to watch for changes
class EmojiMemoryGame: ObservableObject {
    // adding @published adds objectwillchange.send() to changing vars
    // this means that "announcements" are sent whenever something changes, telling views to update
    @Published private var model: MemoryGame<String> = EmojiMemoryGame.createMemoryGame();
    
    // static allows you to use a function before you initalize instance
    // static func makes it a function on the type
    static func createMemoryGame() -> MemoryGame<String> {
        let emojisArray: Array<String> = ["ðŸŽƒ", "ðŸ•·", "ðŸ‘»", "ðŸ˜ˆ", "ðŸ§™"].shuffled()
        //creates access to model
        //returns random number between 2 and size of Emoji's Array
        return MemoryGame<String>(numberOfPairsOfCards: Int.random(in: 2...emojisArray.count))
        { pairIndex in
            return emojisArray[pairIndex]
        }
    }
    
    // MARK: - Access to Model
    var cards: Array<MemoryGame<String>.Card> {
